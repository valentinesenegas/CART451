   Perch'd on a lofty oak,
    Sir Raven held a lunch of cheese;
    Sir Fox, who smelt it in the breeze,
      Thus to the holder spoke:--
    'Ha! how do you do, Sir Raven?
    Well, your coat, sir, is a brave one!
    So black and glossy, on my word, sir,
  With voice to match, you were a bird, sir,
  Well fit to be the Phoenix of these days.'
    Sir Raven, overset with praise,
    Must show how musical his croak.
    Down fell the luncheon from the oak;
    Which snatching up, Sir Fox thus spoke:--
      'The flatterer, my good sir,
      Aye liveth on his listener;
      Which lesson, if you please,
      Is doubtless worth the cheese.'
    A bit too late, Sir Raven swore
  The rogue should never cheat him more.
