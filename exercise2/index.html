    <h1>The Fables of La Fontaine</h1>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>Jean de La Fontaine was a French author. He wrote the "Fables" of La Fontaine, which are very well known stories that always have a lesson at the end.</p>
    <p class="small-text">
        The texts that I have chosen are The Council held by the rats, The Dog and Cat, The Fly and The Game, The Frog That Wished to be as Big As The Ox,
    The Grasshopper and the Ant, The Raven and the Fox, The wo Bulls and the Frog, The Wolf Accusing The Fox Before The Monkey.</p>
    </div>


    <p>I created a graph to represent the Repartition of the Length of Tokens. In other words, it shows the <mark><strong>lengths of the words</strong></mark> (number of letters in each word) in the files.</p>

    <img class="img-width-80p" src="Repartition of the Length of Tokens.png" alt="Repartition of the Length of Tokens">

    <p>The repartition is normal, with a lot of words containing between 3 and 5 letters. We can see that very few words have 12 letters.</p>

    For instance, 328 words have 3 letters. 2 words have 12 letters.

    <p>I sent the results from the console directly to a csv file with this: <mark><strong>node index.js > result.csv</strong></mark></p>
