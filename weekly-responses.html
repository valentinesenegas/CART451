      <h2>Week 1: Introduction</h2>

      <p>- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Valentine!
      </p>

      <p>- üëÄ I‚Äôm super interested in UI and UX! I love designing, prototyping, testing new things, creating innovative experiences. Figma is my best friend.
      </p>

      <p>
      - ü¶Ñ On the side, I do freelance jobs in UX and marketing. I have done a little bit of everything, but I wish to specialize myself in UX. I might do a master‚Äôs degree, but for now I‚Äôm really excited about getting a job and working on projects in the real world.
      </p>

      <p>- üå± Other than that, I love outdoor activities, gardening, hiking, camping, all that!

      <h2>Week 2: Crowdsourcing</h2>

<!--       <p class="question">

      <h2>My answer</h2> -->

      <p>
        Crowdsourcing is the collective contribution of many users in the creation of products and services.
        It can result in efficient innovations such as Wikipedia, where anyone anywhere can access free information of high quality.
        It can also be used in research and development: the firm InnoCentive uses the work of hundreds of scientists to find solutions more quickly than if they did internal research.
        However, it may also be detrimental to traditional business.
        In the article <em>‚ÄúThe Rise of Crowdsourcing‚Äù</em>, we learn about the loss of source of income of many photographers due to the emergence of website selling stock photos for a fraction of the price of photographers.
        These stock photo websites are more affordable to anyone, but they compromise the hard work of many professionals.
